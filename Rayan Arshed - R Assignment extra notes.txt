Important to note, after cleaning there still was a missing value in the data
set for the film 'No Reservations' for its lead studio, which having looked up
was also Warner Bros, so the data has been filled in manually instead of being
removed as the rest of the entry was valid, while the other missing values were 
related to scores and calculations such as profitability. 

Box Plot in my Dashboard was created via Box and Whisker Plot by MAQ Software
within Power BI's extensions for more visualisations.

Dashboard can be filtered and drilled down by using the selections from the 
visualizations, allowing the client to drill down specific areas like
genre or studio, and the film filter exists to drill down even further
to specific movies, if they wish to. Everything is interactive and 
allows the user to find the specific information they desire.
