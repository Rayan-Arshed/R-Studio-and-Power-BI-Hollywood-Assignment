# R-Studio-and-Power-BI-Project

## Overview
A project utilising R Studio and Power BI to import a dataset of movies, clean it of missing values, and perform an initial statistical analysis, before exporting it to Power BI to create a dashboard for a client's request. This assignment tested my coding abilities, by utilising R Studio for data processing and cleaning, as well as dashboard creation via Power BI. Marked Grade: Distinction

## Project Goals
The goal of this project was to refine my R Studio abilities and my coding skills with a new language, ensuring that I can use it to clean the dataset and remove null values, as well as to test my ability to create dashboards for clients, taking into consideration their requirements for data presented once again as well as a relevant colour scheme. The client reuquested to know about these key points:
- THe average Rotten Tomatoes ratings for each genre
- The number of movies produiced per year
- The audience score for each film
- The profitability per studio
- The worldwide gross per genre
All of these have been included, alongside their requirement of developing the dashboard with a Blue, Green, and Brown colour scheme in mind to match brand colours.

## Tools and Technologies Used
### R Studio
- Omitting null values, cleaning data
- Summary() for finding statistical values for the data
- Calculating the IQR of the data set's fields
- Using Tidyverse library to create a bar and scatter plot

## Strong Points of my Work
- Cleaning Data
- Going out of my way to calculate IQR as an initial analysis
- Clear documentation for my processes in my R Script
- Creating varied visualizations for my Dashboard
- Taking into account colour scheme into my Dashboard design

## Repo Sections
- Initial dataset
- R Script File
- Cleaned dataset
- Dashboard as a .pbix file
- Extra write up notes in a text file containing extra information about my process
- Screenshots of dashboard below
